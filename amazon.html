People are not allowed to use this plant in commercial materials, however there was a listing on your site with a product made with these materials. You haven’t addressed this controversy yet, but there is pressure to address this. ", "You decided to address the controversy publicly. Unfortunately, this brought a lot more publicity to the situation, and many more people became angry with you and the company. ", "You decided to shut down the branch without addressing the controversy publicly. While some people were angry that you didn’t address it publicly, this was the correct decision, as publicly addressing the controversy would have likely caused more people to learn about it and get angry at your company."];
			let q2 = ["You export goods to two countries, however, these countries are now at war. Do you:", "You immediately cut off all supplies from both countries, choosing neutrality over conflicts or taking sides. Your business does take a massive financial hit with profits dipping and some supplies being cut off. But you do gain global respect, and future trades start opening with you.", "You choose to serve only one country and cut off the other. The country that you helped appreciate it but the other country that you cut off counts it as betrayal. They blacklist your products and your brand becomes a political tool."];
			let q3 = ["You have recently been sued for letting so many fake items of a copyrighted character be produced and sold through Amazon. You claim it’s fair use, and you don’t have direct control over it, but you could take the listing down. Do you:", "You chose to attempt to fight the copyright claims in court. Unfortunately, you did not end up winning the court case. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on legal fees, and you were forced to take the listings with the copyrighted characters down anyway.", "You decided to settle with the people that sued you outside of court and mostly comply with their demands. This was the correct decision, as you would likely have not won the court case and would have most likely been forced to take the items down anyway."];
			let q4 = ["You are partnered with another company in another country that exports materials to you which you use to manufacture your products. However, because of economic troubles in that country, prices of materials have risen. There are multiple other companies that would export to this country for similar prices or even lower prices, however, you have been working with this company for many years. Do you:", "Your choice to stay with the company and buy the goods at a higher price causes you to have to sell your product at a higher price. People are not happy that the price has increased, and many people are choosing to buy similar and cheaper products from your competitors. Your sales have dipped quite a bit and you are also receiving a decent amount of negative press around your product now.", "Your choice to choose a new company has made you able to keep the price of your product the same. The public is happy, and you are doing fairly well compared to your competitors. You’re also making a significant amount of profit because of the lower cost of materials. "];

It violates a law in India known as the Flag Code, which makes it illegal to produce memorabilia with the flag. The Minister of External Affairs in India has threatened to take away Amazon employees’ visas. If Amazon doesn't take down the listing and issue an apology, this will be enacted.", "You chose to take down the listings of the rugs with the flag on them and issue a public apology. While this did bring slightly more attention to the issue, it was still the better option than having employee visas taken away.", "You chose to ignore the threat from the Minister of External Affairs in India and leave the listings for the rugs up. This decision led to employee visas being taken away, making it much harder to deliver items to India."];

It may be hard to find a date so that all employees can attend the meeting again, though. Do you:", "Your choice makes the employees pretty happy that the meeting was canceled even if they didn’t celebrate the holiday. The employees who celebrated the holiday thank you for having the holiday off. The meeting takes a while to reschedule but it happens eventually.", "Your choice causes several employees to protest the meeting being on that holiday, and many don’t show up. The employees are generally pretty angry at you, and one of them has even quit over this incident."];
			let q7 = ["One of your policies for turning books into eBooks makes it so that some books can only be sold on your platform. This agreement is completely legal in the United States but not legal in the European Union due to concerns that this agreement may lead to monopolies. It violates the Antitrust Law in the EU, which means that companies are not allowed to make monopolies on a certain market, and this agreement has led to Amazon essentially monopolizing the market for a lot of eBooks. An investigation was conducted and found that you were violating these laws and are being taken to court for this. Do you:", "You chose to say that you did nothing wrong and fight the accusation in court. Unfortunately, the court decided that your actions were illegal, and you were fined quite a bit of money and forced to change your policies anyway.", "You chose to change your policies in order to comply with the laws of the European Union. This was definitely the correct choice, as what your company was doing was blatantly illegal in the EU, and you would almost certainly have lost the court case."];
			let q8 = ["Your company is currently under fire for its environmental impact on places around the world, including its effects on native animals or plants that your products have. Multiple environmental activist groups have protested the amount of waste that your products produce and how your manufacturing impacts the environment. The media is pressuring you to give a response. Do you:", "Your choice to release a statement around how you're reducing pollution leads to mostly positive reception from the project, many of the environmental groups have stopped protesting you, and some are even praising you for making strides to be more environmentally friendly.", "Your choice to release a statement about how, no matter what, your product will always produce a significant amount has angered the public. Many people are boycotting or not buying your product, There is also a substantial amount of negative media coverage talking about how you haven't even attempted to be environmentally friendly."];

Some people were unhappy that you were selling these items on your website at all, while others said that you should be able to sell these items to places that allowed them. Do you:", "You chose to stop selling the products and issue a public apology about the situation. This was the correct choice, as continuing to sell the products could have caused Amazon to temporarily be banned in certain states and countries until the items were taken down.", "You chose to continue to sell the products and say that you do not have control of what people sell on your website. Unfortunately, some of the states and countries in which the items were illegal decided to temporarily ban Amazon, which ended up forcing you to remove the items anyway."];
			let q10 = ["A company in your country is struggling because people prefer to buy cheaper, imported products from international brands. The company’s owner asks for your advice on how to compete in a globalized market. What advice do you give:", "You chose to tell the company to lower their prices to match other competitors. While this may bring in some new customers, the loss in profits from making their products cheaper greatly outweighs the benefit from getting some new customers.", "You chose to tell the company not to decrease their prices and instead focus more on making high-quality products to attract loyal customers. This worked well for the company, and lowering their prices would have resulted in lost profits that would not have been made up for by a small increase in new customers."];

			let q4e = ["Your choice to stay with the company that supplies you with materials caused the price of your product to increase and many customers to switch to your competitors.", "Your choice to switch to a different company for materials caused you to not have to raise the price of your product."];
