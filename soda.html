People are complaining that they won’t be able to afford Mexican Coca-Cola anymore. Do you:", "You chose to keep the price of the Mexican Coca-Cola lower, even though the price of the cane sugar increased. While this did allow more people to purchase the drink, the lost revenue from keeping the price lower eventually led to Mexican Coca-Cola being discontinued.", "You chose to increase the price of the Mexican Coca-Cola to account for the price increase of cane sugar. While some people stopped purchasing the Mexican Coca-Cola because of its price, many of them switched to regular Coca-Cola instead, so not much revenue was lost."];
			let q2 = ["You export goods to two countries, however, these countries are now at war. Do you:", "You immediately cut off all supplies from both countries, choosing neutrality over conflicts or taking sides. Your business does take a massive financial hit with profits dipping and some supplies being cut off. But you do gain global respect, and future trades start opening with you.", "You choose to serve only one country and cut off the other. The country that you helped appreciate it but the other country that you cut off counts it as betrayal. They blacklist your products and your brand becomes a political tool."];

However, previous executives in the company have resisted making this change for many years. Do you:", "People in Catalonia were very happy that you finally decided to translate Coca-Cola products. While this barely affected revenue, it made a lot of people very happy.", "While your choice not to translate the products didn’t affect revenue much, many people in Catalonia were still not happy. The campaign to translate the products continues with no sign of stopping."];

However, because of economic troubles in that country, prices of materials have risen. There are multiple other companies that would export to this country for similar prices or even lower prices, however, you have been working with this company for many years. Do you:", "Your choice to stay with the company and buy the goods at a higher price causes you to have to sell your product at a higher price. People are not happy that the price has increased, and many people are choosing to buy similar and cheaper products from your competitors. Your sales have dipped quite a bit and you are also receiving a decent amount of negative press around your product now.", "Your choice to choose a new company has made you able to keep the price of your product the same. The public is happy, and you are doing fairly well compared to your competitors. You’re also making a significant amount of profit because of the lower cost of materials. "];

However, this costs slightly more to manufacture, and many people do not like this change.", "While some people were not happy about this change, not much revenue was lost overall. People eventually got used to this change, and now many people like it.", "Unfortunately, you did not win the court case. Millions of dollars were wasted on legal fees, and you had to change the design of the cap anyway."];

It may be hard to find a date so that all employees can attend the meeting again, though.

The employees who celebrated the holiday thank you for having the holiday off. The meeting takes a while to reschedule but it happens eventually.", "Your choice causes several employees to protest the meeting being on that holiday, and many don’t show up. The employees are generally pretty angry at you, and one of them has even quit over this incident."];

However, it is still allowed in Europe, and many people there enjoy the current taste of Diet Coke. Do you:", "While people in the United States were displeased with the new taste of Diet Coke, people eventually got used to it, and the loss of profits was minimal.", "People all around the world were angry that the formula was changed, even though cyclamates were still allowed in countries outside of the United States. Because of all of the protests, your company was eventually forced to switch the formula back, which was quite expensive."];

Multiple environmental activist groups have protested the amount of waste that your products produce and how your manufacturing impacts the environment. The media is pressuring you to give a response. Do you:", "Your choice to release a statement around how you're reducing pollution leads to mostly positive reception from the project, many of the environmental groups have stopped protesting you, and some are even praising you for making strides to be more environmentally friendly.", "Your choice to release a statement about how, no matter what, your product will always produce a significant amount has angered the public. Many people are boycotting or not buying your product, There is also a substantial amount of negative media coverage talking about how you haven't even attempted to be environmentally friendly."];

However, these sweeteners are quite a bit more expensive, and the company would lose a lot of revenue. Do you:", "The new sweeteners that you use cost more, which has increased the price of Coca-Cola products quite a bit. However, this was the better option, as attempting to fight these regulations in court would have cost a lot and would probably not have been successful.", "Your attempt to fight these new regulations in court cost a lot of money in legal fees, and you eventually ended up losing the case, so you were forced to use the more expensive sugars anyway."];

The company’s owner asks for your advice on how to compete in a globalized market. What advice do you give:", "You chose to tell the company to lower their prices to match other competitors. While this may bring in some new customers, the loss in profits from making their products cheaper greatly outweighs the benefit from getting some new customers.", "You chose to tell the company not to decrease their prices and instead focus more on making high-quality products to attract loyal customers. This worked well for the company, and lowering their prices would have resulted in lost profits that would not have been made up for by a small increase in new customers."];
