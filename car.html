Do you:", "Your choice to not sell cars in the United States has led to controversy and bad press. People are angry because many people in America were interested in purchasing your cars. You also aren’t making as much revenue as other countries that serve the United States. Eventually after years of lost revenue you started selling cars there anyway.", "Your choice to manufacture some cars with the wheel on the left has brought significant extra revenue to your company. It does cost some extra money to train employees on how to manufacture cars with the wheel on the left and hiring extra employees to only work on making cars with the wheel on the left but the extra money is worth it. Your company is making significantly more revenue now."];

Your business does take a massive financial hit with profits dipping and some supplies being cut off. But you do gain global respect, and future trades start opening with you.", "You choose to serve only one country and cut off the other. The country that you helped appreciate it but the other country that you cut off counts it as betrayal. They blacklist your products and your brand becomes a political tool."];

You forgot to change one thing, though; the speedometer is still in kilometers. Multiple Americans have been given tickets, and one person even went to jail for not following the speed limit. They are now suing and demanding that you pay for this mistake.", "Your choice leads to some criticism of your company for making such an egregious mistake, however people have been praising your company for how you went about dealing with this issue. The media coverage is mixed but somewhat positive.", "Your choice to blame customers takes you both to court.

The vehicles require a much more thorough inspection and have to be certified safe. Do you:", "You chose to spend the extra money to pay European workers for safety certifications for your cars.

However, you just got caught cheating on these tests. Do you:", "Your choice leads to heavy backlash over you faking test results with heavy media scrutiny. Multiple groups are now boycotting your company and sales have dropped substantially. While it was the morally correct option, it ended up hurting your company quite a bit.", "Your choice still leads to some controversy but the public still continues to buy your car. Sales are fine.

Do you:", "You chose to ignore the protests and continue to produce cars in the other country. While the protests did continue, they were not large enough to gain widespread media attention, and many people are happy with the cheaper prices of the cars.", "You chose to open a few factories in your country to attempt to stop the protests.

The company’s owner asks for your advice on how to compete in a globalized market. What advice do you give:", "You chose to tell the company to lower their prices to match other competitors. While this may bring in some new customers, the loss in profits from making their products cheaper greatly outweighs the benefit from getting some new customers.", "You chose to tell the company not to decrease their prices and instead focus more on making high-quality products to attract loyal customers.
