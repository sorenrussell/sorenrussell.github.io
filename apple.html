These governments claim that for national security and legal enforcement reasons, they need more oversight into the data being stored on smartphones sold within their borders. Do you:", "You chose to comply with their demands and change your privacy policies. This allowed your company to get back into those markets quickly and boost sales, but many people stopped trusting Apple because of the lower privacy policies, which negatively impacted sales.", "You chose to take the case to international trade courts. This caused your company to lose sales in those countries for now and face legal costs, but people around the world respect Apple for standing firm on privacy."];
			let q2 = ["You export goods to two countries, however, these countries are now at war. Do you:", "You immediately cut off all supplies from both countries, choosing neutrality over conflicts or taking sides. Your business does take a massive financial hit with profits dipping and some supplies being cut off. But you do gain global respect, and future trades start opening with you.", "You choose to serve only one country and cut off the other. The country that you helped appreciate it but the other country that you cut off counts it as betrayal. They blacklist your products and your brand becomes a political tool."];

Many people are upset and protesting for better working conditions for your employees. Do you:", "You take action to protect human rights, improve global working standards, and hold companies accountable. This earns international respect and support from labor groups and voters. While the cost of products may rise a bit, many people are very happy with your decision anyway.", "You avoid conflict and keep Apple’s production smooth and prices steady in the short term. However, people get angry and accuse you of ignoring human rights issues, and media pressure grows. Many people are angry, and your sales decrease."];

However, because of economic troubles in that country, prices of materials have risen. There are multiple other companies that would export to this country for similar prices or even lower prices, however, you have been working with this company for many years. Do you:", "Your choice to stay with the company and buy the goods at a higher price causes you to have to sell your product at a higher price. People are not happy that the price has increased, and many people are choosing to buy similar and cheaper products from your competitors. Your sales have dipped quite a bit and you are also receiving a decent amount of negative press around your product now.", "Your choice to choose a new company has made you able to keep the price of your product the same. The public is happy, and you are doing fairly well compared to your competitors. You’re also making a significant amount of profit because of the lower cost of materials. "];

Do you:", "Most leaders reject the idea of custom Apple products, and they go ahead with the ban. This makes Apple look desperate and weak, giving the company a bad image in the global media.", "A few countries do ban Apple products, but it's a small percentage of Apple’s global market. Sales barely drop, and Apple’s strong brand image stays intact. Even if you had talked to the leaders of the countries, they still would have most likely banned the products anyway."];

It may be hard to find a date so that all employees can attend the meeting again, though.

The employees who celebrated the holiday thank you for having the holiday off. The meeting takes a while to reschedule but it happens eventually.", "Your choice causes several employees to protest the meeting being on that holiday, and many don’t show up. The employees are generally pretty angry at you, and one of them has even quit over this incident."];

This is a serious problem because Taiwanese manufacturers produce motherboards, one of the most critical components in every Apple product. Without them, your production line could slow down or even stop. Do you:", "Taiwan agrees to continue working with Apple after negotiations. While Apple avoids production disruptions, the cost of motherboards rises slightly due to new terms. There’s also the potential for future political risks, especially if tensions between Taiwan and other countries escalate, but for now, production and sales continue smoothly.", "Shifting to new suppliers proves challenging. The contracts take time to finalize, and quality issues arise, delaying production. This results in significant financial losses, with Apple losing about $35 billion in sales due to product shortages."];

Multiple environmental activist groups have protested the amount of waste that your products produce and how your manufacturing impacts the environment. The media is pressuring you to give a response. Do you:", "Your choice to release a statement around how you're reducing pollution leads to mostly positive reception from the project, many of the environmental groups have stopped protesting you, and some are even praising you for making strides to be more environmentally friendly.", "Your choice to release a statement about how, no matter what, your product will always produce a significant amount has angered the public. Many people are boycotting or not buying your product, There is also a substantial amount of negative media coverage talking about how you haven't even attempted to be environmentally friendly."];

These tariffs have significantly raised production costs, and now, you must decide how to handle the financial burden. Do you:", "You chose to raise the prices of your products. Unfortunately, many people were not happy with this change and could not afford to purchase your products anymore. Many of these people are now switching to some of your competitors, such as Android.", "You chose to keep the prices of your products the same.

The company’s owner asks for your advice on how to compete in a globalized market. What advice do you give:", "You chose to tell the company to lower their prices to match other competitors. While this may bring in some new customers, the loss in profits from making their products cheaper greatly outweighs the benefit from getting some new customers.", "You chose to tell the company not to decrease their prices and instead focus more on making high-quality products to attract loyal customers. This worked well for the company, and lowering their prices would have resulted in lost profits that would not have been made up for by a small increase in new customers."];
